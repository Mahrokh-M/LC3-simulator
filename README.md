# LC3 Simulator

## Overview

This project implements a simulator for the LC3 (Little Computer 3) architecture. The simulator includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for uploading and assembling LC3 assembly code, managing memory, and executing instructions. The project is organized into several components, each handling specific aspects of the LC3 simulation.

## Features

- **Upload and Assemble**: Upload LC3 assembly code and assemble it into machine code.
- **Memory Management**: Manage and visualize LC3 memory contents.
- **Instruction Execution**: Execute LC3 instructions step-by-step.
- **File Operations**: Read from and write to files to load/save LC3 memory states.
- **Assembler**: Convert LC3 assembly code to machine code.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Qt framework installed
- C++ compiler

### Building and Running

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Open in Qt Creator:**

## Implementation Details

### Project Structure

The project is structured into several key components that manage different aspects of the LC3 simulation:

- **Logic**: Handles the main application logic and user interface interactions.
- **LC3Registers**: Manages the LC3 CPU registers.
- **LC3Memory**: Manages the LC3 memory operations.
- **LC3Instructions**: Implements the LC3 instruction set including fetch, decode, execute operations.
- **FileReadWrite**: Handles file operations for reading from and writing to files.
- **AssemblerLogic**: Logic for assembling LC3 assembly code into machine code.
- **Assembler**: Manages the assembly process.

### Algorithms and Methods

- **Assembly Process**: The assembler parses the assembly code, resolves labels, and converts instructions into machine code using a two-pass algorithm. It validates instruction formats and processes directives like ORG to correctly place instructions in memory.

- **Instruction Execution**: Instructions are fetched from memory, decoded, and executed in accordance with the LC3 architecture. Each instruction set (A and B) is handled separately to ensure accurate operation.

- **Memory Management**: LC3 memory is managed using a dedicated class that provides read and write operations, ensuring efficient memory access during program execution.

### Design Patterns

- **MVC Architecture**: The project follows a Model-View-Controller architecture where the logic (controller) interacts with the GUI (view) and manages data through models (registers, memory).

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Assembler Optimization**: Initially, assembler performance was a concern due to large file sizes. Implementing optimizations such as caching label addresses and using efficient data structures helped improve assembly speed.

- **GUI Responsiveness**: Ensuring the GUI remained responsive during intensive operations like instruction execution required careful thread management and event handling.

### Future Improvements

- **Debugger Functionality**: Introduce debugging tools such as breakpoints, variable inspection, and step-by-step execution.
  
- **Enhanced Memory Visualization**: Improve the memory viewer to display memory contents in various formats (hexadecimal, ASCII, etc.) for better debugging and analysis.

### Usage

- Start the simulator from Qt Creator.
- Load an assembly file by clicking 'File' > 'Open' and selecting your .asm file.
- Assembel the code and execute it using the 'next cycle'.
- or write your code in text edit ðŸ˜€
